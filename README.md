# Look it Up

## Description
**Look it Up** is a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly look up the meaning of a selected word on the current tab.
Created it because of my never ending situation of : changing the current tab, looking up for the meaning of a word, and then coming back.
**I coded it to display just one meaning of the word since I created it to experiment upon Google Chrome Extensions and Manifest V3. Hence, it doesn't always work. So, yeah, there's so many features and updates we can add to it.**

## Features
- Adds a context menu item to look up the meaning of selected text.
- Fetches word meanings from a free dictionary API.
- Displays the meaning in an alert box.
